## Case description

In the following project we put our hands on marketing study of a bank with 18,000 current bank customers.

Apart from the other banking and loan services, the bank provides credit card services that are a very important source of revenue. 
We have analyzed the data to understand the demographics and other characteristics of Banks customers that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card and built a Machine Learning model that, based on information about customer, predicts whether the customer would accept the credit offer or not.
